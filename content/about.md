On a whim, James and Julia decided to only watch Eddie Murphy movies during the month of May 2020. It turned out to be a lot of fun, so they ran with the concept, choosing a new actor each month and going deep (perhaps too deep) into their filmography.

By September, they'd gotten so into these monthly film festivals that they decided to share them with the world in the form of a podcast. That podcast is now known as Deep Dish Movie Month.

Now their DC apartment is not just a place to ride out the pandemic, but also a place to record themselves discussing some of film's biggest questions: what would a Jim Carrey theme park be like? If they made a 3D sequel to *The Nutty Professor: The Klumps*, how many times would we see Sherman Klump's buttons pop off three-dimensionally? And what kind of mattress salesman looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger?
