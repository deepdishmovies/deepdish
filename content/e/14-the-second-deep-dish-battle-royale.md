Remember that time in September when we picked a bunch of characters from the first four movie months and made them fight in a battle royale? And how Conan the Barbarian won the first Deep Dish Heavyweight Championship? No? Well, that happened, and now it's happening again, except it's characters from all eight movie months so far.
