OK BUT REALLY THOUGH. We're talking Samuel L. Jackson, and while we do get into those motherfuckin' snakes this time, we're more interested in smart sharks and giant squids. This episode has all the unmanageable fauna you could ever ask for. And also? Also??? We write some end credits raps.

This episode's films: Do the Right Thing, Juice, Die Hard With a Vengeance, The Great White Hype, Deep Blue Sea, Shaft (2000), Snakes on a Plane, Big Game, Sphere.
