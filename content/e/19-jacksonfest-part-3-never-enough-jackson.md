Grab yourself a Royale with Cheese and settle in for the final episode of Jacksonfest, a.k.a. Samuel Apri(L.) Jackson, a.k.a. Samuel March Jackson. You thought us watching 28 Tom Hanks movies in a row was wild? No. Do not sleep on the filmography of Mr. Jackson. The box office champ is now the Deep Dish record-holder too. We watched 34 SLJs, motherfuckers.

This episode's films: Cell, 1408, Jumper, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Negotiator, Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, Jackie Brown.
