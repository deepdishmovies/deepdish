My fellow Americans! How do you like to celebrate the Fourth of July? We bet it's not usually by listening to this podcast, but it could be! Come, join us on this special Thin Crust edition of Deep Dish, and marvel at the spectacle of the four failed Fantastic Four movies as they destroy their beloved source material, exploding it like so many fireworks in the night sky.

This episode's films: The Fantastic Four (1994), Fantastic Four (2005), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), Fant4stic (2015)
