We know what you're about to say: you've had it with these motherf\*\*\*in' snakes on this motherf\*\*\*in' plane. We can sympathize. An aircraft is no place for limbless reptiles. We're here for you, and we'll talk through all of it on this episode of Deep Dish Movie Month, all about the one and only Samuel L. Jackson.
