Settle in with a cup of cocoa and prepare to have your heart warmed by the crackling fireplace of Tom Hanks' early filmography. This episode of Deep Dish Movie Month is all about this secular saint and the unparalleled ease with which he inhabits both comedic and dramatic roles, and it is also about how we need more theme restaurants based on his movies. James and Julia hope to tuck you in, dear listener, with a soft and cozy audio blanket in the shape of Mr. Hanks, so put those feet up and relax awhile.

This episode's films: Mazes & Monsters, Splash, Bachelor Party, Turner & Hooch, Big, The 'Burbs, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, Joe Versus the Volcano, Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13, That Thing You Do!, and Saving Private Ryan.
