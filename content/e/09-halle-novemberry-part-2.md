In this episode of Deep Dish Movie Month, James and Julia struggle to find gratitude for the cruel world that would allow a film like "Cloud Atlas" to exist. And what kind of loving god would give us "Darktide"? We hope you've found satisfaction in Thanksgiving leftovers, because this latter half of Halle NovemBerry films will give you no such thing.

This episode's films: Swordfish, Darktide, Monster's Ball, Boomerang, Perfect Stranger, Cloud Atlas, Executive Decision, Die Another Day, The Flintstones.
