Grab your leg warmers and spandex, because it's time to get in shape. No, we're not talking new year's resolutions. We're talking Jane Fonda's Original Workout (1982), among other things. We're stealing the Criterion Collection's idea for a featured actor this month, and we think you'll understand why.

This episode's films: Cat Ballou, Spirits of the Dead, Barefoot in the Park, The China Syndrome, Klute, Fun with Dick and Jane, Monster-in-Law, Book Club, 9 to 5.
