James and Julia spent their December confirming what you've always suspected: the only thing wrong with Tom Hanks' filmography is that there isn't enough Hanx in it. In this second episode of the Hanksidays season, they'll discover the joys (and "hmm"s) of Tom's post-2000 movies, and achieve a new record for movies watched in a month: 28. Take that, Arnold Schwarzenegger! (We still love you, Arnold.)

This episode's films: The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, Cast Away, The Circle, Road to Perdition, Larry Crowne, Sully, Captain Phillips, The Terminal, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, The Post, Bridge of Spies, Charlie Wilson's War, Catch Me If You Can.
